## 🏗️ Infrastructure Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
```
[Frontend React App] 
    ↓ (AWS Amplify)
[AWS Cognito User Pool] → [User Groups: BasicUsers, OrgUsers, Development, Testing]
    ↓ (ID/Access Tokens)
[API Gateway] → [Cognito Authorizer]
    ↓ (Authorized Requests)
[Lambda Functions] → [DynamoDB Tables] & [S3 Bucket]
```

### Data Flow
1. **Registration**: Frontend → API Gateway → Lambda → Cognito + DynamoDB
2. **Authentication**: Frontend → Cognito → JWT Tokens
3. **API Requests**: Frontend (with JWT) → API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB
4. **File Upload**: Frontend → S3 (with IAM role credentials)
5. **Audit Logging**: All operations → DynamoDB System Logs table

### Security Layers
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito with MFA support
- **Authorization**: Role-based access via Cognito Groups
- **API Security**: JWT token validation + WAF (production)
- **Data Security**: IAM policies + DynamoDB encryption
- **Network Security**: VPC endpoints and security groups

## 💡 Configuration Tips

### Environment Variables for Frontend
After deployment, update your React app with these variables from `test_config.json`:

```env
REACT_APP_AWS_REGION=us-east-2
REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOL_ID=<from terraform output>
REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=<from terraform output>
REACT_APP_AWS_IDENTITY_POOL_ID=<from terraform output>
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=<from terraform output>
REACT_APP_S3_BUCKET=<from terraform output>
```

### Terraform Customization
Key variables you might want to customize:
- `domain_name` - Custom domain for your API
- `environment` - Environment name (dev/staging/prod)
- `aws_region` - AWS region for deployment
- `project` - Project name prefix for resources

### Security Considerations
- Review IAM policies for least-privilege access
- Enable MFA for admin users
- Configure VPC endpoints for enhanced security
- Set up AWS Config for compliance monitoring
- Enable AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
