## Deployment Workflow

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Review current infrastructure state: `terraform plan`
- [ ] Ensure AWS credentials are configured
- [ ] Verify you're in the correct environment (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Backup current Terraform state

### Standard Deployment Process

1. **Plan Phase**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/daclab-ai/dev/AWS-DevOps/apps/ai-nexus-workbench/infrastructure
   
   # Edit dynamodb-feature-modules.tf
   # Set the desired feature flag to true
   
   # Review planned changes
   terraform plan
   ```

2. **Apply Phase**:
   ```bash
   # Apply the changes
   terraform apply
   
   # Verify deployment
   terraform output deployed_features
   ```

3. **Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Check table creation in AWS
   aws dynamodb list-tables --region us-east-2
   
   # Or use the MCP tool
   # aws-dynamodb list_tables
   ```

### Rolling Back a Feature

If you need to roll back a feature deployment:

```bash
# Edit dynamodb-feature-modules.tf
# Set the feature flag back to false

terraform plan  # Review what will be destroyed
terraform apply # Apply the rollback
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Rolling back will delete tables and all data. Ensure you have backups!

## Development Recommendations

### Feature Development Order
1. **Start with Phase 1** (Project Management) - Provides foundation for organizing work
2. **Move to Phase 2** (Agent Builder) - Core AI functionality
3. **Add remaining phases** based on priority and user needs

### Database Design Benefits
- **Multi-tenant isolation** via organization_id and user_id prefixes
- **Time-ordered queries** with created_at/updated_at sort keys
- **Efficient access patterns** via strategic GSI placement
- **Proper data modeling** keeping items under 400KB (large objects in S3)
- **Built-in TTL** for automatic cleanup where appropriate
- **Point-in-time recovery** enabled for production environments
- **Server-side encryption** enabled throughout

### Frontend Integration Points

Each feature area provides clean integration points:

#### Project Management
- **Dashboard**: Show user's recent projects and workspaces
- **Navigation**: Project/workspace selection dropdowns
- **Permissions**: Role-based access control for projects

#### Agent Builder  
- **Toolset Section**: Full visual agent builder interface
- **Templates**: Reusable flow templates gallery
- **Prompts Library**: Shared prompt management
- **Version Control**: Agent versioning and history

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### After Each Deployment
- [ ] Verify all tables were created successfully
- [ ] Check CloudWatch metrics for new tables
- [ ] Test basic CRUD operations via AWS console or MCP tools
- [ ] Update Lambda environment variables if needed
- [ ] Document any configuration changes

### Regular Maintenance
- Monitor table usage and optimize GSI usage
- Review point-in-time recovery settings
- Check TTL configurations for data lifecycle
- Update IAM policies as new tables are added

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Table Creation Fails**:
- Check IAM permissions for DynamoDB operations
- Verify Terraform state is not corrupted
- Ensure no naming conflicts with existing tables

**Performance Issues**:
- Review GSI usage patterns
- Check for hot partitions
- Consider adjusting billing mode

**Access Issues**:
- Update IAM policies to include new table ARNs
- Check Lambda function environment variables
- Verify organization-level access controls

## Next Steps

Once you're ready to deploy your first feature area:

1. Choose **Phase 1 (Project Management)** or **Phase 2 (Agent Builder)** based on your development priorities
2. Update the feature flag in `dynamodb-feature-modules.tf`
3. Run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`
4. Begin developing the frontend components for that feature area
5. Test the integration end-to-end
6. Move to the next phase when ready

The infrastructure is designed to be production-ready from day one, so you can deploy features confidently as you build them!
