## ⏳ PENDING: CloudFront Cache Invalidation

### The Issue
CloudFront is still serving cached HTML responses for JavaScript files. The S3 files are correct, but CDN cache needs manual invalidation.

### Required Action
**You need to manually invalidate CloudFront cache:**

1. **Find your CloudFront distribution**:
   - AWS Console → CloudFront
   - Look for distribution serving `www.diatonic.ai`
   - Note the Distribution ID (format: `E123ABCDEFGHIJ`)

2. **Create invalidation**:
   - CloudFront Console → Your Distribution → Invalidations tab
   - Click "Create invalidation"
   - Add paths: `/index.html` and `/*`
   - Click "Create invalidation"

3. **Alternative CLI method** (if you find the distribution ID):
   ```bash
   aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
     --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID \
     --paths "/index.html" "/*"
   ```

---

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After CloudFront invalidation (takes 1-5 minutes):

### 1. Test Asset MIME Types
```bash
# Should return: content-type: application/javascript
curl -I https://www.diatonic.ai/assets/index-DzYP2ee5.js

# Should return: content-type: text/css  
curl -I https://www.diatonic.ai/assets/index-BxurtWjp.css

# Should return: content-type: text/html
curl -I https://www.diatonic.ai/index.html
```

### 2. Browser Test
1. Open **https://www.diatonic.ai** in **Incognito/Private window**
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools → Console tab
3. Should see **NO** "Failed to load module" errors
4. Should see the full Diatonic AI landing page

### 3. Expected Results
- ✅ Dark purple gradient background
- ✅ "The Ultimate AI Ecosystem" hero text
- ✅ Feature cards for Education, Toolset, Lab, Community
- ✅ Interactive React Flow demo
- ✅ Full page functionality with no white screen

## 🚨 If Issues Persist After Invalidation

### Run Diagnostic Script
```bash
./scripts/diagnose-deployment.sh
```

### Check for CloudFront Configuration Issues
The root cause was CloudFront SPA routing misconfiguration. If invalidation doesn't fix it completely, you may need to:

1. **Create asset-specific behavior**:
   - Path pattern: `/assets/*`
   - No custom error responses
   - Allow GET/HEAD methods only

2. **Fix default behavior**:
   - Remove global 404→index.html mappings
   - Use CloudFront Functions for smart SPA routing

### Emergency Rollback (if needed)
```bash
aws s3 cp deployment-backup-20250909-175635/index.html.backup \
  s3://diatonic-prod-frontend-bnhhi105/index.html
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The deployment will be fully successful when:
- ✅ JavaScript assets return `Content-Type: application/javascript`
- ✅ CSS assets return `Content-Type: text/css`  
- ✅ HTML returns `Content-Type: text/html`
- ✅ Browser loads full landing page without white screen
- ✅ Browser console shows no module loading errors

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Immediately**: Manually invalidate CloudFront distribution
2. **Wait 1-5 minutes**: For cache invalidation to complete
3. **Test**: Open www.diatonic.ai in incognito browser window
4. **Verify**: Run diagnostic script if needed
5. **Celebrate**: Site should be fully functional! 🎉
