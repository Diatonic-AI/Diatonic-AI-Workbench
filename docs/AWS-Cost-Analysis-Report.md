## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Public IPv4 Address Charges ($25.24/month)
- **5 Elastic IP addresses** allocated and in use
- **Cost:** $0.05/hour per address = $12.62 for 15 days
- **Issue:** Each EIP costs $36/month when associated with resources
- **Associated with:** NAT Gateways (not EC2 instances)

### 2. NAT Gateway Infrastructure ($45-60/month estimated)
- **5 NAT Gateways** currently active across multiple VPCs:
  - `nat-03248494d21af0066` in vpc-06d0d2402de4b1ff4 (since Aug 25)
  - `nat-0758a0db3bd99891c` in vpc-06d0d2402de4b1ff4 (since Aug 25)
  - `nat-0833a128c524fd2d5` in vpc-0afa64bf5579542eb (since Sep 7)
  - `nat-0f3fd40edbc652cd9` in vpc-01e885e91c54deb46 (since Aug 25)
  - `nat-08e1714d36022a078` in vpc-06d0d2402de4b1ff4 (since Aug 25)

- **Cost Structure:**
  - NAT Gateway hours: $0.045/hour = $32.40/month each
  - Data processing: $0.045/GB processed
  - **Total estimated:** $162/month for 5 gateways + data processing

### 3. Over-Provisioned Infrastructure
- **Multiple VPCs** with separate NAT infrastructure
- **Redundant availability zone** setup might be excessive for dev/staging
- **Load balancers** running constantly ($16.20/month for ALB)

### 4. AWS Support Plan
- **Developer Support:** $29/month minimum or 3% of AWS usage
- May not be necessary for current usage patterns

## üí° Immediate Cost Optimization Recommendations

### üéØ Quick Wins (Implement in 1-2 weeks)

#### 1. NAT Gateway Consolidation - **SAVINGS: $32-65/month**
**Action:** Reduce from 5 to 2-3 NAT Gateways

```bash
# Current NAT Gateways (5 total)
# Target: Keep 2-3 for production workloads, remove dev/staging redundancy

# Consolidation Plan:
# - Keep NAT in production VPC (vpc-06d0d2402de4b1ff4): 1-2 gateways
# - Remove NAT from staging VPC (vpc-0afa64bf5579542eb): Save $32.40/month
# - Evaluate necessity of NAT in vpc-01e885e91c54deb46
```

**Risk:** Low for dev/staging environments  
**Effort:** Medium (requires routing table updates)

#### 2. Elastic IP Optimization - **SAVINGS: $10-18/month**
**Action:** Release unused or consolidate EIPs

```bash
# Current: 5 EIPs @ $3.60/month each = $18/month
# Target: 2-3 EIPs for production only

# Implementation:
# 1. Identify which EIPs are for NAT gateways vs other services
# 2. Release EIPs associated with removed NAT gateways
# 3. Use ALB/CloudFront for web-facing services instead of EIPs
```

**Risk:** Very Low (most services don't need static IPs)  
**Effort:** Low

#### 3. Load Balancer Optimization - **SAVINGS: $8-12/month**
**Action:** Evaluate ALB necessity for development environments

```bash
# Current ALB: aws-devops-dev-alb in vpc-0afa64bf5579542eb
# Consider: Direct service exposure for dev/testing
# Or: Use single ALB with path-based routing
```

**Risk:** Low for development  
**Effort:** Medium

#### 4. AWS Support Plan Review - **SAVINGS: $29/month**
**Action:** Downgrade to Basic Support (free) if appropriate

- **Current:** Developer Support ($29/month)
- **Alternative:** Basic Support (free) for dev/personal projects
- **Keep if:** You need business-hours support via case system

**Risk:** Lose case-based support  
**Effort:** Very Low

### üîß Medium-Term Optimizations (1-2 months)

#### 5. VPC Consolidation Strategy
**Action:** Consolidate multiple VPCs where appropriate

```bash
# Current VPCs identified:
# - vpc-06d0d2402de4b1ff4 (primary)
# - vpc-0afa64bf5579542eb (secondary)
# - vpc-01e885e91c54deb46 (third)

# Consolidation Benefits:
# - Reduced NAT Gateway costs
# - Simplified network architecture
# - Lower data transfer costs
```

#### 6. VPC Endpoints Implementation
**Action:** Add VPC Endpoints for S3/DynamoDB/other services

- Replace NAT Gateway traffic for AWS services
- **S3 Gateway Endpoint:** Free
- **DynamoDB Gateway Endpoint:** Free
- **Interface Endpoints:** $7.20/month but can reduce NAT data processing

#### 7. Right-sizing Analysis
**Action:** Monitor ECS and other compute for utilization

- Current ECS costs suggest running containers
- Implement CloudWatch monitoring for rightsizing
