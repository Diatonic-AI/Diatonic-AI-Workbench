## Discrepancy Analysis

### Why GitHub Still Shows Vulnerabilities

The difference between local npm audit (0 vulnerabilities) and GitHub Dependabot (3 vulnerabilities) could be due to:

1. **Database Differences**: GitHub uses GitHub Security Advisory database which may include advisories not yet in npm's database
2. **Transitive Dependencies**: GitHub may detect vulnerabilities in deeper dependency chains
3. **Timing**: GitHub's database may be more recent or include different sources
4. **Scanning Methodology**: Different tools may have different vulnerability detection approaches

### Recommended Actions

1. **Monitor GitHub Security Tab**: Regularly check https://github.com/Diatonic-AI/Diatonic-AI-Workbench/security/dependabot
2. **Enable Dependabot PRs**: Allow Dependabot to create automatic pull requests for security updates
3. **Regular Updates**: Run security updates monthly or when new vulnerabilities are discovered
4. **Multi-tool Scanning**: Use both npm audit and GitHub security scanning for comprehensive coverage

## Security Monitoring Schedule

### Daily
- [ ] Monitor application logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Check AWS CloudTrail for unusual API calls

### Weekly  
- [ ] Review GitHub security alerts
- [ ] Run `npm audit` locally
- [ ] Check for outdated packages with `npm outdated`

### Monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies with security patches
- [ ] Review and rotate sensitive credentials
- [ ] Perform comprehensive security audit
- [ ] Review IAM permissions and access logs

### Quarterly
- [ ] Security architecture review
- [ ] Penetration testing (if applicable)
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Review and update security policies

## Security Tools and Commands

### Audit Commands

## Emergency Response Procedures

### If High/Critical Vulnerability Detected

1. **Immediate Assessment**
   - Determine if vulnerability affects production
   - Identify affected components and data
   - Assess potential impact and exploitation risk

2. **Quick Mitigation**
   - Apply available patches immediately
   - If no patch available, implement workarounds
   - Consider disabling affected features temporarily

3. **Update and Test**
   - Update affected packages
   - Run full test suite
   - Perform security regression testing
   - Deploy to staging for validation

4. **Deploy and Monitor**
   - Deploy to production during maintenance window
   - Monitor application and security logs
   - Validate fix effectiveness
   - Document incident and resolution
