## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Update Nameservers at Domain Registrar

**WHERE:** Log into your domain registrar where you purchased `diatonic.ai`

**CHANGE FROM (Route53):**
```
ns-1632.awsdns-12.co.uk
ns-710.awsdns-24.net
ns-1432.awsdns-51.org
ns-45.awsdns-05.com
```

**CHANGE TO (Cloudflare):**
```
jacob.ns.cloudflare.com
miki.ns.cloudflare.com
```

### Step 2: Monitor Migration Progress

**Immediate (0-2 hours):**
```bash
# Test DNS propagation
dig diatonic.ai @1.1.1.1
dig www.diatonic.ai @1.1.1.1

# Should show: 54.164.205.174 (your load balancer)
# Instead of: 3.170.152.x (CloudFront IPs)
```

**Ongoing (2-48 hours):**
- Monitor Cloudflare dashboard for traffic
- Test all subdomains for functionality
- Check SSL certificates are working

## 📊 EXPECTED MIGRATION TIMELINE

| Time | Expected Status | Action |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **0 hours** | Nameservers updated at registrar | ✅ |
| **1-2 hours** | DNS starts propagating globally | Monitor |
| **6-12 hours** | Most traffic routing through Cloudflare | Verify |
| **24-48 hours** | Full global propagation complete | Test & Validate |

---

## 🧪 TESTING COMMANDS (Use These During Migration)

### DNS Resolution Testing
```bash
# Test current DNS status
nslookup diatonic.ai 1.1.1.1        # Cloudflare DNS
nslookup diatonic.ai 8.8.8.8        # Google DNS  
nslookup diatonic.ai 208.67.222.222 # OpenDNS

# All should eventually show: 54.164.205.174
```

### Website Functionality Testing
```bash
# Test SSL and basic connectivity
curl -I https://diatonic.ai
curl -I https://www.diatonic.ai
curl -I https://app.diatonic.ai
curl -I https://dev.diatonic.ai
curl -I https://api.diatonic.ai

# Should show Cloudflare headers and valid SSL
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Test compression (should show br/brotli)
curl -H "Accept-Encoding: br,gzip" -I https://diatonic.ai

# Test cache headers
curl -I https://diatonic.ai/static/some-file.css
```

## 🆘 ROLLBACK PLAN (If Needed)

If anything goes wrong during migration:

### Quick Rollback (1-2 hours)
1. **Immediately change nameservers back** to Route53:
   ```
   ns-1632.awsdns-12.co.uk
   ns-710.awsdns-24.net
   ns-1432.awsdns-51.org
   ns-45.awsdns-05.com
   ```

2. **Wait for DNS propagation** (1-2 hours)

3. **Verify services are back** to original state

### When You Might Need Rollback
- SSL certificate issues (unlikely with Universal SSL)
- Cache behavior problems affecting functionality
- Unexpected traffic routing issues
- Application-specific compatibility problems

**Risk Assessment: LOW** - Your configuration is standard and well-tested

## 🎯 POST-MIGRATION CLEANUP (Week 2+)

Once migration is successful and stable:

### AWS Resource Cleanup (Cost Savings)
```bash
# 1. Disable CloudFront distributions (saves ~$20-40/month)
aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id EB3GDEPQ1RC9T
aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id EQKQIA54WHS82
# (Follow AWS docs to disable)

# 2. Delete Route53 hosted zone (saves ~$0.50/month)
aws route53 delete-hosted-zone --id Z032094313J9CQ17JQ2OQ
# (After confirming no other dependencies)

# 3. Review ACM certificates (may be able to delete unused ones)
aws acm list-certificates --region us-east-1
```

### Terraform Cleanup
- Remove CloudFront resources from Terraform
- Remove Route53 resources from Terraform  
- Keep Cloudflare resources as the new standard
