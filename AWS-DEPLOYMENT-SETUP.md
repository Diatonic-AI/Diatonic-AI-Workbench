## üöÄ Deployment Workflows

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The `.github/workflows/amplify-deploy.yml` workflow has been configured to:

1. **Automatically determine environment** based on Git branch:
   - `main` ‚Üí Production environment
   - `staging` ‚Üí Staging environment
   - `develop` (or other branches) ‚Üí Development environment

2. **Use appropriate service account credentials** for each environment

3. **Build and test** the application before deployment

4. **Deploy to AWS Amplify** with environment-specific configurations

### Branch-to-Environment Mapping
```
main branch     ‚Üí Production  (amplify-diatonic-ai-prod)
staging branch  ‚Üí Staging     (amplify-diatonic-ai-staging) 
develop branch  ‚Üí Development (amplify-diatonic-ai-dev)
feature branches ‚Üí Development (amplify-diatonic-ai-dev)
```

## üìÅ Local Development Setup

### File Structure Created
```
aws-service-accounts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ amplify-dev-policy.json                    # IAM policy for Amplify development
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cicd-policy.json                           # IAM policy for CI/CD operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ amplify-diatonic-ai-dev-credentials.txt    # Dev environment credentials (NOT in git)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ amplify-diatonic-ai-staging-credentials.txt # Staging credentials (NOT in git)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ amplify-diatonic-ai-prod-credentials.txt   # Production credentials (NOT in git)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ diatonic-ai-cicd-credentials.txt           # CI/CD credentials (NOT in git)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev-env.sh                                 # Script to load dev environment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging-env.sh                             # Script to load staging environment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prod-env.sh                                # Script to load production environment
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SECURITY-RECOMMENDATIONS.md               # Security best practices
```

### Environment Scripts
To work with different environments locally:

```bash
# Development environment
source aws-service-accounts/dev-env.sh
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Staging environment  
source aws-service-accounts/staging-env.sh
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Production environment
source aws-service-accounts/prod-env.sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Scripts

### 1. Service Account Setup
```bash
./scripts/setup-aws-service-accounts.sh
```
Creates all AWS IAM service accounts with appropriate policies and access keys.

### 2. GitHub Secrets Update
```bash
./scripts/update-github-secrets.sh
```
Updates GitHub repository secrets with AWS credentials from service accounts.

### 3. Local Amplify Initialization
```bash
./scripts/init-amplify-local.sh
```

### 4. Development with Amplify
```bash
./scripts/dev-with-amplify.sh
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Credential Protection
- ‚úÖ Credentials are **never committed to git** (added to `.gitignore`)
- ‚úÖ Secrets are stored securely in **GitHub Actions secrets**
- ‚úÖ Local credential files are **excluded from version control**
- ‚úÖ Each environment uses **separate service accounts**

### 2. Access Control
- ‚úÖ **Principle of least privilege** applied to each service account
- ‚úÖ **Environment separation** enforced at the IAM level
- ‚úÖ **Production access** restricted to production-specific service account
- ‚úÖ **Audit trail** maintained through AWS CloudTrail

### 3. Key Rotation
- üîÑ **Regular rotation** recommended (every 90 days)
- üîß **Automated rotation** can be implemented with AWS Systems Manager
- üìä **Usage monitoring** through CloudWatch metrics

## üåê AWS Console Access

### Amplify Console
- **URL**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-east-2#/
- **Account**: 313476888312
- **Region**: us-east-2 (Ohio)

### IAM Console (Service Accounts)
- **URL**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-2#/users
- **Users Created**:
  - amplify-diatonic-ai-dev
  - amplify-diatonic-ai-staging  
  - amplify-diatonic-ai-prod
  - diatonic-ai-cicd

## üìã Next Steps

### 1. Initialize Amplify Locally
```bash
# Use development environment
source aws-service-accounts/dev-env.sh
./scripts/init-amplify-local.sh
```

### 2. Configure Application
- Review generated GraphQL schema
- Customize authentication settings
- Configure storage permissions
- Set up hosting distribution

### 3. Deploy to Environments
```bash
# Push changes to trigger deployments
git push origin develop   # ‚Üí Development
git push origin staging   # ‚Üí Staging  
git push origin main      # ‚Üí Production
```

### 4. Monitor Deployments
- GitHub Actions: https://github.com/Diatonic-AI/Diatonic-AI-Workbench/actions
- Amplify Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-east-2

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If Credentials Are Compromised
1. **Immediately disable** access keys in AWS Console
2. **Generate new access keys** using the setup script
3. **Update GitHub secrets** using the update script
4. **Review CloudTrail logs** for unauthorized activity
5. **Rotate all related secrets** (database passwords, API keys, etc.)

### Recovery Commands
```bash
# Disable compromised keys (replace ACCESS_KEY_ID)
aws iam update-access-key --user-name amplify-diatonic-ai-dev --access-key-id ACCESS_KEY_ID --status Inactive

# Recreate service accounts
./scripts/setup-aws-service-accounts.sh

# Update GitHub secrets
./scripts/update-github-secrets.sh
```

## üìû Support

For issues with AWS deployment setup:
1. Check AWS CloudTrail logs
2. Review GitHub Actions workflow logs  
3. Verify service account permissions
4. Test AWS CLI connectivity locally
