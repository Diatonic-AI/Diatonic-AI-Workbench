## üìÅ Detailed Reports

All detailed reports are available in this directory:
- `cloudfront-*.txt` - CloudFront distribution details
- `amplify-*.txt` - Amplify application and branch details  
- `ecs-*.txt` - ECS clusters, services, and task definitions
- `s3-*.txt` - S3 bucket information
- `vpc-*.txt`, `subnets.txt`, `security-groups.txt` - Network resources
- `ec2-*.txt`, `load-balancers.txt` - Compute resources
- `eventbridge-*.txt` - Event-driven architecture resources
- `lambda-functions.txt`, `api-gateway-*.txt` - Serverless resources

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Review Reports**: Examine each detailed report to understand resource usage
2. **Categorize Resources**: Classify resources as KEEP, REMOVE, or REVIEW
3. **Create Cleanup Plan**: Generate safe deletion scripts with dependency checking
4. **Execute Cleanup**: Run cleanup scripts in dry-run mode first, then execute

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Notes

- Always backup critical data before deletion
- Check resource dependencies before removing anything
- Start with unused/orphaned resources
- Verify Amplify and MinIO S3 resources are preserved
- Test remaining infrastructure after cleanup
