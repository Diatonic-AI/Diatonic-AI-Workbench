# S3 Buckets - REVIEW (Potential Duplicates)

## Analysis Required
These appear to be duplicate development buckets with different suffixes.
Need to determine which are active and which can be removed:

### dzfngw8v Series (Created: 2025-09-07)
- aws-devops-dev-application-development-dzfngw8v
- aws-devops-dev-backup-development-dzfngw8v
- aws-devops-dev-compliance-development-dzfngw8v
- aws-devops-dev-logs-development-dzfngw8v
- aws-devops-dev-static-assets-development-dzfngw8v

### gwenbxgb Series (Created: 2025-08-25)
- aws-devops-dev-application-development-gwenbxgb (OLDER)
- aws-devops-dev-backup-development-gwenbxgb (OLDER)
- aws-devops-dev-compliance-development-gwenbxgb (OLDER) 
- aws-devops-dev-logs-development-gwenbxgb (OLDER)
- aws-devops-dev-static-assets-development-gwenbxgb (OLDER)

## Recommendation
Keep the newer dzfngw8v series and remove the older gwenbxgb series after verifying no critical data exists.
